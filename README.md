# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a simple web application that simulates the functionality of an Etch-A-Sketch toy. Users can create and modify a grid of square divs by hovering over them with their mouse, creating a pixelated drawing effect.

## Features

- Create a grid of square divs with a default size of 16x16
- Hover over the squares to change their color randomly or progressively darken them by 10%
- Reset the grid by clicking a button and entering a new grid size (up to 100x100)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The default 16x16 grid will be displayed.
3. Hover over the squares with your mouse to change their color.
4. Click the "Reset Grid" button and enter a new grid size (up to 100x100) to create a new grid.
